This Project was written in Azure Data Studio on Azure AQL Edge in Docker

The project makes a table on NHL players through the years 2008-2021 by cleaning and preparing the data from multiple csv files

The table is then analyzed and many skills in SQL are shown

The data set is also exported to csv for use in Tableau

Some Steps Taken

- Importing csv files
- Combining different files into one table
- Cleaning and checking the data for errors
- Filtering the data frame for desired columns and column values
- Adding new column for total assists
- Using CTEs
- Using Temporary tables
- Exporting to csv for use in Tableau
